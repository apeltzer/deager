# DEAGER CLI
## Installation
This is the docker helper client for the EAGER Pipeline. Now we added precompiled binaries for Ubuntu, which don't require you (ideally) to compile them yourself. In this case you could simply clone this repository (or download the binary directly in the /bin/Ubuntu/) folder to your system and then start using it as usual. For more documentation on how to do this, please refer to the EAGER user manual at http://eager.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contents/installation.html#docker
